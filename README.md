# Emulators
A collection of C#-made emulators. Currently planned:
Chip-8
Nintendo Gameboy

and maybe more if I feel like it.

# Info
This is mostly just practice. I've made multiple emulators in the past but they never really worked or got finished. This time, I want to create a collection of emulators that I will hopefully actually finish.

These are NOT supposed to be the most accurate emulators. I will declare an emulator "finished" when it can pass basic opcode tests as-well as run some basic ROMs (in the case of the Nintendo Gameboy and similar, this should include 1 commercial game or atleast a complex enough game to test most aspects of the emulator)

# Why?
As aforementioned, practice. It lets me practice more low level aspects of programming and also allows me to practice optimization.
